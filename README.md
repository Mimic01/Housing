Data science study about housing prices in california


This belongs to the second chapter of the book "Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit Learn Keras and Tensorflow" a great source for learning.
Since this is a backup for my studies i add some comments of my own or reflect the author's comments on the code. I highly recommend this book
if you're into training data science and acquiring good practices since the author makes a lot of mentions about deploying your model on a
productive pipeline, some great insights.

Feel free to use this code for study and keep in mind that i do not own this code and all credits go to the books author (Aurelien Geron)
